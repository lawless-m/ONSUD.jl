# ONSUD

A package for turning the CSV files from GB's ONSUD open data into something more useful.

The Office for Nation Statistics produces the ONS UPRN Directory (ONSUD) for Great Britain. 

"The ONSUD relates the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) for each GB address from AddressBase® Epoch 88 to a range of current statutory administrative, electoral, health and other statistical geographies. The ONSUD is produced by ONS Geography, who provide geographic support to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and geographic services used by other organisations. The ONSUD is issued every 6 weeks and is designed to complement the Ordnance Survey AddressBase® product."

There doesn't seem to be a homepage for it, so this link will have to do
